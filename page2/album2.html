            My Chemical Romance's second studio album, "Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge", was released in 2004. This album has well defined characters and a central theme, but not a directly correlated or sensical plot or storyline, so much of the story is fan hypothesis. According to Way, the album can be understood as a "pseudo-conceptual horror story". It tells the story of a Man and a Woman who are separated by death in a gunfight and he goes to hell. The devil says he can be with her again if he brings him the souls of a thousand evil men and the Man agrees to do it, so the devil hands him a gun.

            It begins (Helena) with the story behind the death of the Woman and the angry hurt of the Man after her death. He is self destructive through grief and is having difficulty saying goodbye, wanting to be with her in death but knowing he should stay. The next song (Give 'em Hell Kid) is where his journey begins; he takes drugs and laments how he is scared without the Woman and misses her. The third song on the album (To the End), in this context, seems like the Man has crashed a wedding party to claim souls, and excuses it by saying the bride and party members are all rich, self-involved and fake. He also seems to question whether the Woman would go to the same lengths for him. In the next song (You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison), the Man is caught and in prison is made to perform sexual acts with another man. He wonders what will become of him. In the fifth song (I'm Not Okay (I Promise)), it's made clear the Man is not okay and he’s thinking back over his relationship with the Woman and saying she doesn’t understand the pain he is in. The next song (The Ghost of You) is about loss, grief and trying to accept that maybe she is “never coming home” no matter what he does. Haunted by the memory of her death and her ghost, he wonders whether or not he should end it all to be with her in death or just accept her death. In the seventh song (The Jetset Life is Gonna Kill You), exhausted by the killing and the drugs he uses to keep him going, the Man expresses his need to give up and talks about how hard it is to live when you feel like you’re not alive.

            The eighth song (Interlude) is a short break where the protagonist prays for his lover's safety while they are separated. It focuses on the Man's desperation to see the Woman again. In the ninth song (Thank You for the Venom), the Man has lost all hope. All he knows now is death, destruction, and loss. He is scornful of his quest against death. The tenth song (Hang 'em High) talks about the killing of the Man, wondering if the Woman will be the same when she comes back from the dead? Will she accept him? What would she think of what he has done? He struggles with this thought as he speeds faster to his destination. In the eleventh song (It's Not a Fashion Statement, It's a Fucking Deathwish), the very angry Man  pleads to get rid of the ghosts that haunt him. He’s lost his fear of dying now, he only wants to be with the Woman. In the twelfth song (Cemetery Drive), the Man talks about how hard this journey has been, how much he misses the woman, and contemplates suicide. He asks the devil if this is what he wanted all along, the pain and torture and the loss of his soul. In the thirteenth and final song (I Never Told You What I Do for a Living), the Man contemplates the life he has created, and who he has become in this quest. A fourteenth song, released as a demo (Bury Me in Black), is an afterthought conclusion to the story. The Man accepts that he is too far gone. He’s seen too much, done too much, and is forever lost. He has realised that a deal with the Devil is never straightforward, and that he has been tricked. He has to kill himself as the final soul to bring the Woman back to life.
