           My Chemical Romance is an American rock band from New Jersey. The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist Gerard Way, lead guitarist Ray Toro, rhythm guitarist Frank Iero, and bassist Mikey Way. The band was formed by vocalist Gerard Way and drummer Matt Pelissier in New Jersey, soon after the September 11 attacks. Witnessing the World Trade Center towers fall influenced Way's life to the extent that he decided to start a band. Matt Pelissier drummed for the band on their first two albums before being replaced with Bob Bryar. Bryar was the drummer for the band until leaving in 2010 for personal reasons. Jarrod Alexander has been drumming for the band since 2011, through their album "The Foundations of Decay", and during their recent tour.
