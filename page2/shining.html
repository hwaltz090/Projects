            The Shining follows Jack Torrance, who becomes the winter caretaker of the isolated Overlook Hotel, bringing his wife and young son—who has psychic abilities—into its eerie emptiness. As winter closes in, the hotel’s dark influence drives Jack toward madness. Stanley Kubrick’s adaptation is celebrated for its unsettling atmosphere, innovative cinematography, and Jack Nicholson’s iconic performance, making it a must-see classic of psychological horror.

            The Shining is a 1980 psychological horror film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick and co-written with novelist Diane Johnson. It is based on Stephen King's 1977 novel and stars Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd and Scatman Crothers. The Shining has since been critically reappraised and is often cited as one of the best horror films ever made.
