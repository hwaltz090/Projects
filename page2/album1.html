            My Chemical Romance's debut album, "I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love," was released in 2002. The music style that My Chemical Romance demonstrated in this album has been considered influential of the sound of the emo music genre, due to its unorthodox composition style compared to contemporary emo bands at the time. The album showcases the band's raw energy and emotional intensity, blending punk rock and post-hardcore influences. Notable tracks include "Vampires Will Never Hurt You" and "Honey, This Mirror Isn't Big Enough for the Two of Us." The album received critical acclaim for its passionate lyrics and dynamic sound, establishing My Chemical Romance as a prominent force in the alternative music scene. This album doesn't have a direct story, as the others do, but is about a Bonnie and Clyde style couple, the "Demolition Lovers."</p>

            Shortly after the band formed, they created three songs—"Skylines and Turnstiles", "Cubicles", and "Bring More Knives"—in a makeshift studio set up in Pelissier's attic. These recordings have since been referred to as the "Attic Demos". Two of those songs made it onto this album. The album was recorded and produced in the span of only a week with practically no budget; during production, all five members of the band and some of the production crew shared a single hotel room. The premise of the last song on the album, "Demolition Lovers", has been tied to the concept of the band's next studio album, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. While very few songs from this album have been consistently performed at My Chemical Romance's live shows, "Vampires Will Never Hurt You" and "Our Lady Of Sorrows" became concert staples. The album didn't get much attention at debut, but has since become an influential and iconic piece of the genre.
