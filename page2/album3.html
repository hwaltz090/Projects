          My Chemical Romance began work on their third studio album, The Black Parade, in early 2006 at S.I.R. Studios in New York,with the band's frontman Gerard Way aiming to create an album centered around life and death. He eventually came up with idea of a concept album centered around a man dying of cancer, known as Patient, as he nears the end of his life. Death then presents itself to the Patient in the form of his fondest childhood memory: his father taking him to see a marching band when he was a child.

        <h2>Story Behind the Album</h2>
        <section>
            <p>
             <b>The End</b> is the first song on the album, where we're introduced to The Patient on his deathbed. He understands he's going to die and has somewhat accepted it, yet in the outro repeatedly pleads to be saved while simultaneously telling anyone left trying to help him to just walk away, knowing his illness is fatal and wanting to give up on himself. The next song <b>Dead</b> steps back in time before his diagnosis and begins with a flatline as The Patient's heart has temporarily stopped while in the hospital. He is revived with his mother at his bedside. The first chorus of the song is him coming to the realization that he is dying and has nobody that would care. <b>This Is How I Disappear</b> is The Patient realizing that nobody will miss him, and that his memory will fade to nothing as the one person he loved doesn't care for him anymore. Not only in life are they separated but in death they will be too since he's done many things he is ashamed of and will go to hell. His lost love, on the other hand, will go to heaven as "all the good girls go". <b>The Sharpest Lives</b> takes another step back in time when his lover decided to leave him. He let alcohol and drugs consume him. In the chorus he promises that if he had her back he would give up all of his addictions. Despite this, she left him. The album continues with <b>Welcome to the Black Parade</b>. His fondest memory is of his father taking him to see a parade in the city when he was a child, so that's the form death takes when it finally comes to escort him into the afterlife. His father asked him to "be the savior of the broken, the beaten, and the damned" so The Patient tries to be optimistic about his memory carrying on through loved ones. In his eyes he's still no hero, but he's learned to embrace himself for who he is. In <b>I Don't Love You</b>, The Patient reflects back to his break-up with his lover. While he loved her very much he forced her away from him out of his own hate for himself, worrying that he would ruin her. He eventually starts berating her with insults causing her to leave but breaking her in the process, and instilling hatred for him in her. <b>House of Wolves</b> takes place back on the road to the afterlife where the patient realizes he truly is going to hell, yet doesn't have any remorse for his actions. Instead, he mocks those who believe their sins can be concealed by fake faith and a mask of innocence and goodness. He reaches the conclusion that everybody sins and that everybody goes to hell, so why fake who you are. In <b>Cancer</b>, he is asking his loved ones to not be there for him in his dying state but instead to get prepared for his death. The Patient is afraid that if he shows his family himself at this fragile, ugly state that that's how they'll remember him. His family, on the other hand, just wants to love him while he's present, and he realizes that leaving them is the hardest part about his death. .

            Continuing his journey to hell with the track <b>Mama</b>, The Patient is shown a story of a mother and her son who goes to war during World War II. She thinks he's stupid and selfish for going and tells him that if he goes he will die and she'll assume he's dead so it doesn't hurt her when she gets the news that he really did die. He writes her many letters, all of which are ignored until one letter where he tells her that he's killed others but was just following orders. He also writes her of the bad situation his regiment is in and that they all will most likely die. She replies "You're no son of mine, I'm ashamed of what you've done, don't return to me". The soldier goes to battle once more but is shot and is dying, repeatedly crying out "Mama!" Once the mother learns of his death she weeps to herself, having truly loved her son despite what he's done. The Patient realizes that, much like the mother from the story, his mother still does love him despite him giving up on life. <b>Sleep</b> begins with The Patient deciding that if everybody goes to hell, there's really no reason to feel remorseful for your actions. He sees himself as a monster who's undeserving of sympathy and wants others to forget him and move on, no matter how much it may affect them to do so. Over and over again he is reminded of the heinous acts he's committed over his life to the point of being tortured by them, and now that he's dead he can't do anything to make amends. <b>Teenagers</b> doesn't really contribute to the story of The Patient in any way in my opinion, but you could try to work it in by using it to convey how The Patient had a warped, cynical view of the youth of his day or an explanation of The Patient being groomed to be a violent, angry person towards society. <b>Disenchanted</b> is about The Patient looking at how he wasted his whole life waiting for death, yet at the same time being afraid of it. He realizes that while he's held a pessimistic view on how life is just a joke, he could've woken up from his miserable lifestyle and tried to accomplish something. The album closes on <b>Famous Last Words</b>, where The Patient is resuscitated once more to see his lover in his hospital room and professes his unending love for her, but doesn't know if it's a dream or if she's really there. Either way, he has worked through his fear of death.
